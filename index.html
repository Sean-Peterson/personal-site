            Hello, my name is Sean Peterson. I love to solve problems. I love solving problems because it offers opportunity for growth and learning. There is no better feeling than coming up with a solution to a problem. Coding provides the opportunity to solve problems everyday. The opportunity to solve problems everyday is what has led me to become passionate about coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years ago I started my journey at a coding boot camp. It has led to me becoming a freelance developer while I lived in a city without opportunity to work for a software company. I have created a full-stack website for Props Craft Brewery which sees thousands of users per month and has a bounce rate of under 30%. I also have designed and developed single page apps as landing pages for a few different businesses. In-between freelance work I worked on personal projects to keep my skills sharp.
          </p>
          <h3><i>A bit about my coding journey:</i></h3>
          <p>
            It was the fifth week of school and I could not figure out the solution to a problem. I wanted to give up. I had tried to solve the problem at least one hundred times. The program was harder than I thought it was going to be. I stood in my kitchen eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich while staring at the white tile floor and contemplated my best options moving forward. It was in that moment that I decided that giving up was not an option. I figured out the solution to that problem and continued to do so with the plethora of problems that the course introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course taught me many things. One thing I learned was how to learn at a fast pace. Before this experience I had never been forced to learn and reproduce this much information in such a short amount of time. That skill has been extremely valuable to me. When I started my job at Props Craft Brewery I was instructed to get my Cicerone Beer Server Certification. I studied for two hours and took the test. It seemed more difficult than I expected, but I passed. Later I learned that people typically study for that test for over a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another lesson that I learned was how to think with pure logic. I am naturally more of a free flowing thinker rather than a linear thinker. My pair-programming partner and I were tasked with solving a complex problem that included taking a user input and manipulating it to fit specific constraints. Often times I can be apt to taking a shotgun approach where I try anything to make it work. Instead, he taught me how to lay out the constraints logically and how to form tests that will automate simulations of our problem. These tests helped us solve the problem relatively quickly and I gained a new way of thinking to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solving problems is my favorite thing to do. When a new problem arises I smile because it means that there is a new opportunity to create a solution. This aspect of me is what I believe makes me love programming.
          </p>
