          Hello, my name is Sean Peterson. I love a good challenge. I love challenges because they are opportunities for growth and learning. There is no better feeling than solving a problem. Coding provides the opportunity to solve problems everyday. The opportunity to solve problems everyday is what has led me to become passionate about coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coding journey began in 2014. I was a founder of a startup called Cliq. During the startup process I became interested in coding and started messing around on codeacademy.com. The startup failed, but my interest in coding had just begun. I enrolled in Epicodus, a coding bootcamp that is ranked top 5 nationally, located in Portland, Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Epicodus we completed over 45 hours of pair-programming per week. We learned git, html5, css, js, angular.js, ember.js, mysql, php, silex, and drupal. After the classes were over I won an internship at SimB & CO. During the internship I had a week to learn how to use Symfony2 framework and Docker CaaS and then develop an entire website with another intern for a paying client. We developed a training website for the National Guard and OHSU. The project required us to architect a database, create controllers, and design views. It was truly a full-stack job.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my classes at Epicodus I lacked confidence and was unsure if I would feel comfortable telling a prospective employer that I will be an asset to the company. After rocking my internship and personal projects, I have full confidence in my ability to code and learn new technologies. Without a doubt I can be a real asset to any company.
        </p>

        <p>Take Home provides users the ability to calculate how much money they will be taking home after taxes and living expenses based on which city the user lives in. Users can also compare two cities at one time. For example, if a user has a job offer in Los Angeles for 90k and one in San Francisco for 100k then the user can compare the two cities to see in which city they will take home more money. This app was created using symfony2</p>

        <h3 class="sub-headers">CODEpendency</h3>
        <p>CODEpendency was created to help all students at Epicodus study for technical interviews. It is a flashcard app that solves the problem of carrying physical flashcards around. CODEpendency uses an algorithim to make questions that a user gets wrong appear more often. All users can view any deck and answer the questions. When the user decides to "flip" the card to see the answer then the users marks if he/she got the answer right. Each question and answer are saved to the logged in user and that each instance puts a weight on which card will appear next. CODEpendency is an angular2 firebase app.</p>
