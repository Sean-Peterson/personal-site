            I originally created this site to showcase my new skill, programming. Since then life has taken me on a different path. I still enjoy coding, but it is not my passion. The lessons I learned from my journey to become a programmer are priceless to me. The journey to become a programmer was straight uphill with many obstacles. I had to fight everyday to make it through the six month program that included forty-five hours of learning each week. I learned multiple languages and even more frameworks. How to program was not the only thing I learned from the journey, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the fifth week of school and I could not figure out the solution to a problem. I wanted to give up. I had tried to solve the problem at least one hundred times. The program was harder than I thought it was going to be. I stood in my kitchen eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich while staring at the white tile floor and contemplated my best options moving forward. It was in that moment that I decided that giving up was not an option. I figured out the solution to that problem and continued to do so with the plethora of problems that the course introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course taught me many things. One thing I learned was how to learn at a fast pace. Before this experience I had never been forced to learn and reproduce this much information in such a short amount of time. That skill has been extremely valuable to me. When I started my job at Props Craft Brewery I was instructed to get my Cicerone Beer Server Certification. I studied for two hours and took the test. It seemed more difficult than I expected, but I passed. I later learned that people typically study for that test for over a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another lesson that I learned was how to think with pure logic. I am naturally more of a free flowing thinker rather than a linear thinker. My pair-programming partner and I were tasked with solving a complex problem that included taking a user input and manipulating it to fit specific constraints. Often times I can be apt to taking a shotgun approach where I try anything to make it work. Instead he taught me how to lay out the constraints logically and how to form tests that will automate simulations of our problem. These tests helped us solve the problem relatively quickly and I gained a new way of thinking to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solving problems is my favorite thing to do. When a new problem arises I smile because it means that there is a new opportunity to create a solution. This aspect of me is what I believe makes me love working in market research. Clients come to me with problems that they sometimes cannot properly convey. I get to help them uncover their problems, define them, and come up with solutions that solve their problems and serve their underlying needs.
          </p>
